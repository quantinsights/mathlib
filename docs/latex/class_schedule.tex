\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Schedules. 

A common problem in Finance is the derivation of a schedule of dates. The schedule is generally used to determine accrued interest and payments. Building a schedule is conceptually simple, however the devil is in the details. How should end-\/of-\/month be handled? What happens when a cashflow date falls on a holiday? What happens when trying to divide 22 months into 3 month units? The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_schedule}{Schedule}}} class includes constructors that provide powerful mechanisms to create schedules. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_schedule}{Schedule}}} class contains the following mandatory attributes.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily start\+Date}, the start of the first schedule period.
\item {\ttfamily end\+Date}, the end of the last schedule period.
\item {\ttfamily frequency}, regular periodic frequency to use.
\item {\ttfamily business\+Day\+Adjustment}, the business day adjustment to apply I store a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_schedule}{Schedule}} as a vector of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_schedule}{Schedule}} Periods. The following optional items are also available to customize the schedule\+: -\/{\ttfamily start\+Date\+Business\+Day\+Adjustment}, overrides the business day adjustment to be used for the start date. -\/{\ttfamily end\+Date\+Business\+Day\+Adjustment}, overrides the business day adjustment to be used for the end date. -\/{\ttfamily stub\+Convention}, convention defining how to handle stubs. -\/{\ttfamily roll\+Convention}, convention defining how to roll dates. -\/{\ttfamily first\+Regular\+Start\+Date}, start date of the first regular schedule period, which is the end date of the initial stub -\/{\ttfamily last\+Regular\+Start\+Date}, end date of the last regular schedule period, which is the start date of the final stub
