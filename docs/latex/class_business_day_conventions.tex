\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Constants and implementations for standard business day conventions. 

The purpose of each convention is to define how to handle non-\/business days. When processing dates in finance, it is typically intended that non-\/business days, such as weekends and holidays, are converted to a nearby valid business day. The convention, in conjunction with a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_holiday_calendar}{Holiday\+Calendar}} defines exactly how the adjustment should be made. Here is a description of different conventions.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item N\+O\+\_\+\+A\+D\+J\+U\+ST \+: Make no adjustment.
\item F\+O\+L\+L\+O\+W\+I\+NG \+: Move to the next valid business day
\item M\+O\+D\+I\+F\+I\+E\+D\+\_\+\+F\+O\+L\+L\+O\+W\+I\+NG \+: Move to the next valid business day, unless that is in the next month in which case move to the previous valid business day
\item P\+R\+E\+C\+E\+D\+I\+NG \+: Move to the previous valid business day
\item M\+O\+D\+I\+F\+I\+E\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+C\+E\+D\+I\+NG \+: Move to the previous valid business day, unless that is in the previous month, in which case move to the next valid business day
